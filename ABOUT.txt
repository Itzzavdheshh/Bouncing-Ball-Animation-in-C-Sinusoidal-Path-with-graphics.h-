🏀 Bouncing Ball Animation in C (Sinusoidal Path with graphics.h):-


-This project simulates a bouncing ball animation in C using the classic graphics.h library.
-The ball moves from left to right across the screen, following a sinusoidal path that mimics bouncing motion.


💡 Features:-
-Ball follows a smooth sine wave path starting from the ground.
-Animation runs continuously until a key is pressed.
-Uses graphics.h, conio.h, math.h, and dos.h.


🧰 Requirements:-
-Turbo C++ / DOSBox environment (since it uses the Borland Graphics Interface).
-graphics.h must be available in the C:\\Turboc3\\BGI directory.


🛠️ How It Works:-
-The ball's horizontal position (x) increases over time.
-The vertical position (y) is calculated using:
                                            y = baseY - amplitude * fabs(sin(angle));


-This creates a bouncing effect that repeats as the ball wraps from right to left.
